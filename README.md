This is my first repository, created following the guide.
I am kind of interest in coding, but I just start learning and haven't got really much huge progresses yet. I will try anyway.
English is not my first language, so I am not so good at it. I will probably enter an university in an English speaking country so I will practise it as much as I can.
I am born in 2004 and I am a girl, if anyone will ever read this file.
